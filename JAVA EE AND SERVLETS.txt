Basic JEE Servlet and JSP:

DAY 1)Introduction to Web Application:
DAY 2)Servlets in details
DAY 3)Session management
DAY 4)Basics of JSP

--------------------------------------------Introduction to Web Application--------------------------------------------

-->what is web applicationa and why do we prefer web application?
   Application that u access on web are web application, since they are easily accessible and from anywhere and require small set of requirement i.e internet , address link and browser
   
 Server side technology-Servlets
 Client - Server technology
 client(Browser) can interact with server
 client and server talks using protocol(HTTP)
 client uses Http prtocol to interact with server. there are different protocols but oftenly used is HTTP protocol
 
 Browsers sends request to web server and web server reads request and generate response
 
 if request is done using Http request then request is Http request  and response generally in HTML page
 
 Server Side technology
  1)JSP
  2)Java Servlets
  3)Active Server Pages
  4)PHP 
  
  request goes to web server and checks if request is success returns 200 status and  resposne object conatins: content type ,status,etc
  2 types of request : Get and Post
  
  In Request Header:
  type of request , page u r looking for and protocol info , browser
   
  GET and POST(types of request mainly)
 Get-getting or retrieving data from server, you can send data through url and there is some limitations i.e 255 characters
 Post- this request has a body and it encapsulate all the data u want to send to server
 clicking on a hyperlink is genearlly Get request
 
 main job of web server is: to retrieve page and server the page
 but what if there are some conditions or dynamic requirement based on which what to return or create page dynamicaly
 for this third party(serverside application like servlet or jsp) is required to generate dynamic page and send to server  which server returns 

 exchange of request and response_ web conatiner(execution of third party or servlet requests, managing servlets)
 
-->web conatiner:
  1)communication support 
  2)lifecycle management of servlet(i.e creation of servlet object and multithreading support)
  3)Declarative security (web.xml)
  4)JSP support
  internally it is the responsibilty of server to convert jsp pages to servlet
  
 web server is not for handling business logic , it just accepts and generate a response ,for business logic server side technology is required

-->Servlet:
   Basicaaly a servlet is a java class
   and this java class is executed at server and life cycle of it is managed and maintained at server
   We require web server+ web container who manages servlet lifecycle(Here we are using Tomcat)

   Servlet Key API:
   Servlet ServletConfig
   Generic Servlet
   HttpServlet
   
   
 TOMCAT Structure
   webapps
     servlet-Demo(Project your)
	   Web-Inf
	       Classes(.class files)
		   src
		   web.xml

web.xml files is deployment Descriptor


Servlet:
Http servlets have many methods like doGet , doPost

mapping in web,xml regarding servlet class
<servlet> and <servlet-mapping>		   
	   
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------Second Day---------------------------------------------------
 1) Life Cycle of servlet:
 2)How to send parameters and request object 
 3)How to genearte response
 
 in web.xml
 <load-on-startup>:whenever the server is started then that time servlet io loaded
 
 Generic Servlet is an abstarct method
 
 LifeCycle method of any servlet:
 init 
 service
 destroy
  
  
1)  Web conatoner Check whether the servlet is loaded or not
    if not then load the servlet
2) then init initializes the servlet(it is mandatory of for first object  )
  
3)service ande destroy methods

if u want to do some initialization like database connectivity etc 
when object is created at that time it normal java class but when init is 
called simple java object is treated as servlet
 
for loading on startup and when to provide some parameters :
<init -param>

servletConfig -1 per servlets 
servletContext-1 per web application

if a variable needs to be accessed by multiple servlets for that we need to keeep the variale in servletContext

assignment:
1)upload a file (<input type=file>)
2)save data to db from form

scopes:
request
HttpSession
ServletContext


Request Dispatcher:
include(1-2-3-2-1) comes back to first servlet (all servlets responses are accumulated)
forward give call to second servlet and gives result of servlet 2(servlet 2 gives response) but url is of servlet1
